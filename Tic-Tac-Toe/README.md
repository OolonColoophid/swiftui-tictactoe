#  Tic-Tac-Toe

I'm  following the tutorial given by [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCLiPW2ns2w), just to get a sense of what it might be like to write an app in SwiftUI.

This will ultimately become an MVVM app (Model View ViewModel).

## First Go

Having fun! Got to 16:44.

## This is awesome

Just added in a function to check if a square is occupied, and also something to compute the computer's move.

Got to [here](https://youtu.be/MCLiPW2ns2w?t=1634)

## Win, Lose or Draw

This code has now been entered. Next step: Alerts. https://youtu.be/MCLiPW2ns2w?t=2601

## On to alerts

OK, we now get alerts on win, lose or draw, and we reset the game. Next, we'll be improving the AI.

## Improving the AI
OK, the AI now tries to win if it can, or block a winning move from the human, take the middle square, or otherwise pick at random.
